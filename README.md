# tutorials-JavaIsTheNewPython

Java is incorporating new language, compilation, and virtual machine features to open its "inner" world (the JVM) to the outside world (C, Python...) and make it easier to interface with existing libraries. These features simplify programming, benefit the type systems, reduce the risk of run-time errors, as well ease the interfacing with foreign libraries. The main projects bringing these new features to Java are Projects Panama (FFI), Valhalla (value classes/objects), and Babylon (code reflection).

This tutorial introduces the problems solve by these projects, describe each project in turn, and provide concrete code examples for each one of them. It also discusses their limitations and future works.
